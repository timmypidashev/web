## Getting Started 
The Thinkpad T440p is a powerful and versatile laptop that can be further enhanced by installing coreboot, 
an open-source BIOS replacement. This guide will walk you through the process of corebooting your T440p, 
including flashing the BIOS chip and installing the necessary software.

## What You'll Need

Before getting started corebooting your T440p, make sure you have the following:

- **Thinkpad T440p**: This guide is specifically for the T440p model.
- **CH341A Programmer**: This is a USB device used to flash the BIOS chip.
- **Screwdriver**: A torx screwdriver is needed to open the laptop.

## Disassembling the Laptop
1. **Power off your laptop**: Make sure your T440p is completely powered off and unplugged from any power source.
2. **Remove the battery**: Flip the laptop over and remove the battery by sliding the latch to the unlock position and lifting it out.
3. **Unscrew the back panel**: Use a torx screwdriver to remove the screws securing the back panel.
