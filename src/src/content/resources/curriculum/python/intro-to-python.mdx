## Your First Python Program

<FadeIn>

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

</FadeIn>

## Variables and Data Types

<FadeIn>

### Creating Variables
```python
name = "Alice"        # String
age = 25             # Integer
height = 5.6         # Float
is_student = True    # Boolean
```

</FadeIn>

<FadeIn delay={400}>

### Python is <Highlight color="green">dynamically typed</Highlight>
You don't need to declare the type!

```python
x = 42        # x is an integer
x = "Hello"   # Now x is a string
```
