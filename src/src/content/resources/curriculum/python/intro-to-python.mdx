# Welcome to Python! üêç

**A beginner-friendly programming language**

- Easy to learn and read
- Powerful and versatile
- Great for beginners
- Used by major companies
</Slide>

<Slide>
## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level programming language** that emphasizes:

- **Readability** - Code that looks like English
- **Simplicity** - Easy to learn and use
- **Versatility** - Can be used for many things

### Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991

Named after "Monty Python's Flying Circus" üé≠

<Slide>
## Why Learn Python?

### üåê Web Development
Build websites and web applications

### ü§ñ Data Science & AI
Analyze data and build machine learning models

### üéÆ Game Development
Create games and interactive applications

### üîß Automation
Automate repetitive tasks
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Your First Python Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

### How to run it:
1. Open a text editor
2. Type the code above
3. Save as `hello.py`
4. Run with: `python hello.py`
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Variables and Data Types

### Creating Variables
```python
name = "Alice"        # String
age = 25             # Integer
height = 5.6         # Float
is_student = True    # Boolean
```

### Python is **dynamically typed**
You don't need to declare the type!

```python
x = 42        # x is an integer
x = "Hello"   # Now x is a string
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Working with Strings

### String Operations
```python
# Creating strings
greeting = "Hello"
name = "World"

# Concatenation
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(message)  # Output: Hello, World!

# String methods
text = "python programming"
print(text.upper())      # PYTHON PROGRAMMING
print(text.capitalize()) # Python programming
print(text.replace("python", "Python"))  # Python programming
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Numbers and Math

### Basic Math Operations
```python
# Arithmetic operators
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)    # Addition: 13
print(a - b)    # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)    # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)    # Division: 3.333...
print(a // b)   # Floor division: 3
print(a % b)    # Modulo (remainder): 1
print(a ** b)   # Exponentiation: 1000
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Lists - Storing Multiple Values

### Creating and Using Lists
```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing items (indexing starts at 0)
print(fruits[0])    # apple
print(fruits[-1])   # orange (last item)

# Adding items
fruits.append("grape")
fruits.insert(1, "strawberry")

# List methods
print(len(fruits))     # Length of list
print("apple" in fruits)  # Check if item exists
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Control Flow - Making Decisions

### If Statements
```python
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
elif age >= 16:
    print("You can drive!")
else:
    print("You're still young!")

# Comparison operators
# == (equal), != (not equal)
# > (greater), < (less)
# >= (greater or equal), <= (less or equal)
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Loops - Repeating Actions

### For Loops
```python
# Loop through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Loop through numbers
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Count: {i}")  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### While Loops
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(f"Count is {count}")
    count += 1  # Same as count = count + 1
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Functions - Organizing Your Code

### Creating Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    """This function greets someone"""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add_numbers(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return the result"""
    result = a + b
    return result

# Using functions
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Hello, Alice!

sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print(sum_result)  # 8
```
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Practice Exercise

### Build a Simple Calculator
```python
def calculator():
    print("Simple Calculator")
    print("Operations: +, -, *, /")
    
    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    operation = input("Enter operation (+, -, *, /): ")
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
    
    if operation == "+":
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == "-":
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == "*":
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == "/":
        if num2 != 0:
            result = num1 / num2
        else:
            return "Error: Division by zero!"
    else:
        return "Error: Invalid operation!"
    
    return f"Result: {result}"

# Run the calculator
print(calculator())
```
</Slide>
