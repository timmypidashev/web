* The terminal is a way to **talk to your computer** using words instead of clicking.
* It’s like giving your computer instructions directly.
* Powerful, fast, and used by programmers every day!
* It's sometimes called a **command-line** because it accepts commands as instructions

## Opening the Terminal

1. Open your laptops and power them on
2. When prompted to login, enter your credentials:
**Username:** your first and last name (all lowercase, no spaces) `timothypidashev`
**Password:** your birthday in MMDDYYYY format (without slashes) `08052004`
> Once logged in, help the person to your right and left, 
> we will continue when everybody is ready!

## It's Lonely in Here...

Now you should see a **prompt** that looks something like this:
```fish
timothypidashev@laptop1 ~>
```
This might look intimidating, but it's actually telling you useful information!

</Slide>

<Slide large>
## Understanding the Prompt

```fish
timothypidashev@laptop1 ~>
```

Breaking it down:
- **`timothypidashev`** - This is **your username**. It tells you who is currently using the computer
- **`@laptop1`** - This is the **computer's name** (hostname). Useful when working with multiple computers!
- **`~`** - This is your **current location** in the computer. The `~` symbol means you're in your "home" folder
- **`>`** - This is the **prompt symbol**. It's waiting for you to type a command!

## Your First Command - `whoami`

Let's try our first command! Type this and press **Enter**:

```fish
whoami
```

- This command asks the computer: "Who am I?"
- The computer should respond with your username!

> **Try it!** Type `whoami` and press Enter

---
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Where Am I? - The `pwd` Command

Now let's find out exactly where we are in the computer. Type:

```fish
pwd
```

- `pwd` stands for **"Print Working Directory"**
- It tells you the **full path** to where you currently are
- You should see something like: `/home/timothypidashev`

> **Try it!** Type `pwd` and press Enter

---
</Slide>

<Slide>
## Looking Around - The `ls` Command

Let's see what's in our current location. Type:

```fish
ls
```

- `ls` stands for **"list"** - it shows you all the files and folders in your current location
- You might see folders like `Desktop`, `Documents`, `Downloads`, etc.

> **Try it!** Type `ls` and press Enter. What do you see?

## Making Your Mark - The `mkdir` Command

Let's create your first folder using the terminal! Type:

```fish
mkdir my-first-folder
```

- `mkdir` stands for **"make directory"** (folder and directory mean the same thing)
- Now type `ls` again to see your new folder appear!

> **Try it!** Create a folder, then list the contents to see it

---
</Slide>

<Slide large>
## Moving Around - The `cd` Command

Let's go inside the folder we just created. Type:

```bash
cd my-first-folder
```

- `cd` stands for **"change directory"** - it moves you to a different location
- Notice how your prompt changes! The `~` might change to show your new location
- Type `pwd` to confirm where you are now

> **Try it!** Move into your folder and check your location

---
</Slide>

<Slide large>
## Going Back - `cd ..`

To go back to the previous folder (your home), type:

```bash
cd ..
```

- The `..` means **"parent directory"** - the folder that contains your current folder
- You can also type `cd ~` or just `cd` to go back to your home folder anytime

> **Try it!** Go back to your home folder

---
</Slide>

<Slide large>
## Creating Files - The `touch` Command

Let's create your first file using the terminal. Type:

```bash
touch hello.txt
```

- `touch` creates a new, empty file
- Type `ls` to see your new file appear alongside your folder

> **Try it!** Create a file and list the contents to see it

---
</Slide>

<Slide large>
## Cleaning Up - The `rm` Command

Let's clean up by removing the file we just created:

```bash
rm hello.txt
```

- `rm` stands for **"remove"** - it deletes files
- ⚠️ **Warning**: `rm` permanently deletes files - there's no trash can in the terminal!
- Type `ls` to confirm the file is gone

> **Try it!** Remove your file and verify it's deleted
