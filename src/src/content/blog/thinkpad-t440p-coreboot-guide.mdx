## Getting Started 
The Thinkpad T440p is a powerful and versatile laptop that can be further enhanced by installing coreboot, 
an open-source BIOS replacement. This guide will walk you through the process of corebooting your T440p, 
including flashing the BIOS chip and installing the necessary software.

## What You'll Need

Before getting started corebooting your T440p, make sure you have the following:

- **Thinkpad T440p**: This guide is specifically for the T440p model.
- **CH341A Programmer**: This is a USB device used to flash the BIOS chip.
- **Screwdriver**: A torx screwdriver is needed to open the laptop.

## Installing Dependencies

Install the following programs. These will be needed to compile coreboot and flash the BIOS.

<Commands

  archCommand="sudo pacman -S base-devel curl git gcc-ada ncurses zlib nasm sharutils unzip flashrom"
  debianCommand="sudo apt install build-essential curl git gnat libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev nasm sharutils unzip flashrom"
  fedoraCommand="sudo dnf install @development-tools curl git gcc-gnat ncurses-devel zlib-devel nasm sharutils unzip flashrom"
  gentooCommand="sudo emerge --ask sys-devel/base-devel net-misc/curl dev-vcs/git sys-devel/gcc ncurses dev-libs/zlib dev-lang/nasm app-arch/sharutils app-arch/unzip sys-apps/flashrom"
  nixCommand="nix-env -i stdenv curl git gcc gnat ncurses zlib nasm sharutils unzip flashrom"
  client:load
/>

## Disassembling the Laptop
1. **Power off your laptop**: Make sure your T440p is completely powered off and unplugged from any power source.
2. **Remove the battery**: Flip the laptop over and remove the battery by sliding the latch to the unlock position and lifting it out.
3. **Unscrew the back panel**: Use a torx screwdriver to remove the screws securing the back panel.

## Locating the EEPROM Chips

In order to flash the laptop, you will need to have access to two EEPROM chips located next to the sodimm RAM.

## Assembling the SPI Flasher

Place the SPI flasher ribbon cable into the correct slot and make sure its the 3.3v variant

After the flasher is ready, connect it to your machine and ensure its ready to use:

<Command

  command="flashrom --programmer ch341a_spi"
/>

Flashrom should report that programmer initialization was a success.
