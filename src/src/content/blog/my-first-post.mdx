Hello, my name is Timothy Pidashev! I’m an aspiring software engineer currently expanding my technical horizons!

Wait… that was a bit too formal. This is, after all, a blog post. Let me try that again.

Hey 👋, my name is Timothy! I’m a software nerd who loves building cool tech! Phew, that was rough. Jokes aside, 
I’m happy you're here, dear reader. I have a lot planned for my little blog, and I hope the next few posts will 
be useful to many nerds out there!

As a little spoiler of what’s to come, the next post will be a complete dive into modifying and corebooting a 
Thinkpad T440p for the ultimate secure dev laptop! I’ve been personally daily-driving mine for the last two 
years and can’t wait to show it off, so stay tuned!
